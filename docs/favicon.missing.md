A missing favicon is a missed oppertunity to sell your brand, and the defined favicon from your page could not be found.

For more controls browsers allow you to easily confusing the icon using (for example):

```html
<link rel="shortcut icon" href="/favicon.png" />
```

Some browsers (e.g. Firefox) will keep a list of missing favicons, but not all browsers do. Some servers will even go as far as generating a full 404 page for missing resources.  

Having a (cacheable) favicon will prevent this.

_Having a favicon also makes your site stand out more in a users bookmarks list._

# How do I fix this ?

Generate a small, cacheable favicon for your site and link it from your page HTML.
