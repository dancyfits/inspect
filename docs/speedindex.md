When loading pages should be built to load the content of the page as fast as possible. With the rest of the assets loading afterwards. 

[WebpageTest](webpagetest.org) created what they call the [speedindex](https://sites.google.com/a/webpagetest.org/docs/using-webpagetest/metrics/speed-index), which measures how quickly the page contents are visually populated.

The score calculates how complete a page is every step of the rendering process. The faster the page loads content, the lower the score will be.

# How do I fix this ?

Look at the various steps in the filmstrip and improve how quickly the main content of the site is displayed.

Text and basic structure should be visible as fast as possible on the page.
